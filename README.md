# User-Search
This program reads in a specific JSON file that contains a list of users and their corresponding code.
The program prompts the user for a string pattern, and will parse through all the code within the JSON file to see if there are any matches.

The user also has the option to add more usernames and code to the JSON file.
If the user wants to search through the updated JSON file simply rerun the program.
